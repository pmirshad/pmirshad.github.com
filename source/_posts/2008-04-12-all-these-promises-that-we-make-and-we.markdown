{% blockquote Shall We Dance (2004) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358135/ IMDB %}
"[with] All these promises that we make and we break.
Why is it, do you think, that people get married ?"

"Because we need a witness to our lives ???"

There’s a billion people on the planet.
I mean, what does any one life really mean?

But in a marriage, you’re promising to care about everything -
the good things, the bad things, the terrible things, the mundane things...
All of it. All the time, every day.

You’re saying, "Your life will not go unnoticed, because I will notice it."
"Your life will not go unwitnessed, because I will be your witness."
