Yesterday evening was simply great. It brought back some of the few sweet memories I cherish. It all started with Manu's plan to have the dinner at Eat Street, a multi-cuisine food court on the banks of the Hussain Sagar lake, Hyderabad. A wonderful place to be in the evenings. The food is good and the prices are reasonable.

We were having food and Manu had this idea of going for a boat ride in the lake. I was not interested but decided to join them anyway. It was nearing 8:30. So we hurried with the food and took the tickets for the ride.We had to wait in the boat for some time before the boat started its journey. The boat headed for the 16 meter high monolithic Buddha statue on an island in the lake. It looked great with all the lighting effects.

The ride was fun.  :)
