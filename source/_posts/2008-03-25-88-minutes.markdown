{% blockquote 88 Minutes (2007) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411061/ IMDB %}
"I do believe... in the rights of victims. I do believe... that they deserve
recompense. No matter how significant or insignificant it may be... in
comparison to the loss suffered. I've suffered such a loss. And like some of you
here... I've spent those sleepless nights... trying desperately to... squelch
down that bilish instinct for revenge. And I have wondered... If this pain
will... ever abate. I've learnt... that time does not heal the wound. It will
though, in its most... merciful way... blunt the edge... ever so slightly."
