{% blockquote Juno (2007) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/ IMDB %}
"The best thing you can do is find a person
who loves you for exactly what you are.

Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,
handsome, what have you,

the right person is still gonna
think the sun shines out of your ass.

That’s the kind of person
that’s worth sticking with."
